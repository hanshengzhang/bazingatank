	1.How to run?
	      a) Windows: double click the jar file is enough on condition that your Windows has successfully installed Java Runtime Environment(JRE)(Go to: www.java.com for details).
              You do NOT need to extract the jar file.
	      b) Linux: 
	      $ java -jar XXX.jar
	      Above is the common usage. If you encounter audio problem, try running the game using:
	      $ padsp java -jar XXX.jar
	      This command force your program to use Pulse audio driver which supports sound mixing rather than Alsa audio driver. So make sure your Linux has installed Pulse audio driver.
	      Also, your Linux should have successfully installed JRE. We DO recommend Sun JDK instead of OpenJDK.
	2. How to play?
      	       a) One player: WASD for directions and SPACE for shoot
   	       b) Two player: 
	       Player 1 - WASD + SPACE
	       Player 2 - Arrow Key + ENTER
	       c) There are bonuses appearing during the game. Try to catch them
